     <h1>Medically Supervised Weight Loss</h1>
     <div class="cleaner_h30">
                <p>At Premiere Weight Loss our medically supervised program will provide you with the infrastructure to accomplish your weight loss goals quickly and safely. The first phase is the acute weight loss phase, which lasts until the desired weight loss is attained. The second phase is the transitional phase during which you will discontinue your medication, and you will be introduced to a higher caloric diet and increased exercise regimen. The third phase is the long-term maintenance phase, which will give you the support and guidance to remain at your ideal weight. </p>
                <p>Dr. Melinda Lacerna, our Medical Director, has extensive experience in all aspects of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery with special interests in Aesthetic and Reconstructive Breast Surgery, Body Sculpting, and Body Contouring after Massive Weight Loss. </p>
                <p>In 1998, she obtained her Medical Degree from University of California in Irvine; she then pursued her training in General Surgery at Kaiser Permanente in Los Angeles followed by Plastic Surgery residency at Temple University in Philadelphia.</p>
                <p>She is Board Certified by both the American Board of Plastic Surgery and the American Board of Surgery. She is a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons and is a member of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.</p>
                <p>Premiere Weight Loss and Dr. Lacerna both agree that to maintain the best results possible, encouraging our patients to keep a balanced lifestyle with regular exercise and healthy eating will maintain the new self confidence and life optimism that matches your weight loss success and new look! </p>
