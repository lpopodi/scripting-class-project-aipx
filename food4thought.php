                <p>Drink your water. I always carry a water bottle everywhere i go. If you don’t like plain water you might want to try adding lemon or crystal light to add a little flavor to the water. Remember that if you are thirsty you are already dehydrated.

Get rid of your clothes as they get too big. This gets rid of the safety net of having clothes if you gain the weight back. When you lose weight you have to have the mind set that you will not gain it back. If you don’t you are allowing opportunities/excuses to go back to your old lifestyle. I have one pair of jeans that I owned before losing weight, and I put them on once in awhile for motivation.

Dine out without pigging out, Figure out what you are going to eat in advance. Get salad dressing on the side. Restaurants usually put about one quarter cup ( 4 tablespoons) of dressing on a salad, which is too many calories. Your better off if you have 1 to 2 tablespoons. Dip your fork into the dressing and then into the salad. 

Derive yourself worth from something other than a number on a scale and instead gift yourself a body that will function well to serve your life’s goals. 

Brush your teeth early in the evening rather than just before bed. It keeps you from snacking if you’re not really hungry. Remember snacking comes from boredom. 

Commit to one diet and stick to it for life. Start by making a list of low-calorie foods that you love, that you find satisfying; and when you’re hungry make sure you eat lots of those foods.</p>
