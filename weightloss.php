                <p>Premiere Weight Loss in Bradenton’s program consists of a consultation with a counselor. During this time, you will be instructed on our Keys To Success Program, which is proven to lower your blood insulin level. This process increases the body’s ability to burn fat, and creates the foundation for maintaining weight loss. A comprehensive blood panel, EKG, and your weight and body mass index measurement will be performed.</p>
                <p>You will also be provided with a basic exercise regimen, which is a very important component to a successful weight-loss program. A copy of the Weight-Loss Consumer Bill of Rights will be provided in your information packet, and we urge you to review and discuss it with our staff or physician.</p>
                <p>Our physician will then evaluate your medical and weight history, and make the appropriate recommendations for your individualized program. You will be prescribed and dispensed an FDA-approved appetite suppressant, which has been proven to be safe and effective for many years.</p>
                <p>Our weight loss program also utilizes weekly supplementary injections that will enhance your desired weight loss outcome. Our program requires a weekly scheduled visit to assess your progress and dispense your medication. Any indicated changes will be made if needed. We take great pride in our program, and thank you for your confidence and trust in us.</p>

   <h2>HCG Weight Loss</h2>
            
  <div class="two_col float_l">
               <h5></h5>
                <p>HCG, a naturally produced hormone. Combining the   use of small amount of HCG with a low-calorie diet can cause your body   to metabolize and use the abnormal fat through a specific process, reset   the hypothalamus so that once the diet is completed, you eat normally   (of course within healthy limits) while keeping the weight off for life.   By properly following the HCG protocol, you could lose an average of 1   to 2 lbs per day. And you will feel more healthy and energetic with the   HCG Weight Loss plan than you have in years<!-- end of column1--> </p>

                <p>
HCG hormone is able to open fat cell membranes so that fatty acids are able to leave fat cells. This allows clients to take a very strictly applied 500 Calorie diet daily, leading to reduced glycogen and low glucose in the blood. This causes HCG to act. In other words, the low calorie diet causes you to release your unwanted fat (abnormal fat), leaving your normal fat (good fat) and lean body mass, while helping your hypothalamus to reset your system to a normal weight, allowing you to maintain your weight while eating healthy foods after you complete the HCG weight loss protocol.</p>
